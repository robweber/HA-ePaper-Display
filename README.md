# HA Sensor ePaper Display
__Modified for robweber__

E-Paper display for viewing sensor data from Home Assistant. This firmware is based on **ESPhome**, so you need to install ESPhome and compile .yaml file by yourself.

## Hardware

### Parts:
 1. Waveshare 4.2" ePaper display
 2. ESP8266 Wemos D1 Mini or similiar. I used NodeMCU ESP8266
 3. 3D-Printed Case, it can be found on my thingiverse page. [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4772803]
 4. Stock M3 Screws from ePaper display

Note: You might need to apply some adhesives to 3d-printed parts joints, and also put some counterweight on the base to make it harder to tip over. This is my very first time designing 3D things, so itâ€™s not perfect yet.
 
 ### Wiring: 
Connecting the display to Wemos D1 Mini is very straightforward. However, I soldered all wires diretly on both display and MCU in order to make it low-profile as much as possible. Refer to the ESP8266 pinout reference in the images folder if having trouble. 

|ePaper Display Pin| ESP8266 Pin|
|--|--|
| BUSY | GPIO16 |
| RST | GPIO04  |
| DC | GPIO12 |
| CS | GPIO15 |
| CLK | GPIO14 |
| DIN | GPIO13 |
| GND | GND |
| 3.3v | 3.3v |


## How to use?

 1. Install ESPhome on your [computer](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line.html) or [Home Assistant Add-on](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html)
 2. Copy yaml file and fonts folder to your ESPhome folder. __Note__: The fonts must be in the root ESPhome folder, not the project folder. 
 3. Use ESPHome to make a new device and set the basics (Wifi SSID, name, etc). Compile and Upload this to your device. 
 4. Confirm device can talk with ESPHome. 
 5. Connect hardwares together.
 6. Flash firmware with full yml config. 
 7. Confirm you can see everything in ESPHome. 
 8. Enjoy!
